# PLDIY

PLDIY is a simple and customizable **programming language builder**.  
It allows you to define your own language syntax and behavior using a configuration file.  
You can use it to design and run your own mini-programming languages â€” all powered by Python!

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

You change the code of the file named `rules.conf`, which defines how your language should work.

Each rule follows this format:

1. Variables are always all capital
2. Your programming language's syntax -> python's syntax
3. And if you want to make one command do several things, repeat the command for every thing it should do. (Example in `rules.conf`)
4. Whatever you put after onstart() will run as soon as the program starts running. Just like for other rules, repeat onstart() for every thing you want to run on the start of the program.

To run the code, you must save `rules.conf` and go to `converter.py`, where you can see your mini-programming language in action!
