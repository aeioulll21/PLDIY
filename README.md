# PLDIY

PLDIY is a simple and customizable **programming language builder**.  
It allows you to define your own language syntax and behavior using a configuration file.  
You can use it to design and run your own mini-programming languages â€” all powered by Python!

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

You change the code of the file named `rules.conf`, which defines how your language should work.

Each rule follows this format:

1. Variables ar always all capital
2. Your programming languages syntax -> python syntax
3. And if you want to make one command do several things, repeat the command for every thing it should do.

To run the code, you must save `rules.conf` and go to `converter.py`, where you can see your mini-programming language in action!
